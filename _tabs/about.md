Hi, I’m Hassan Alshehri — I’m currently studying Computing Security at RIT, where I focus on areas like malware analysis, system hardening, and security defense. I started this blog to document my technical growth, break down what I’ve learned, and share insights from real projects and challenges I’ve worked on.

Through hands-on labs, red and blue team exercises, and reverse engineering malware samples, I’ve developed a strong interest in how attackers operate—and how to stop them. I’ve explored how to detect and respond to threats across systems and networks.

This blog is a place for me to think out loud, keep learning, and contribute to the infosec community in my own way. 

Appreciate you stopping by.
